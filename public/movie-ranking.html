<h1>The Best Movies According to Chiggy</h1>
<h2>3 of my top movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
An amazing movie that has inspired so many movies to follow. It examines a lot of questions like what it is to be alive, to have free-will, and it also has some kick ass action scenes.
</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</h3>
<p>
A fantastic science fiction movie with a great cast of characters set against an amazing back drop. As a kid, who didn't imagine themselves as Luke Skywalker flying an X-Wing down the Death Star trench and taking the shot that saved the entire Rebel Alliance? An all-time classic.

<h3>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>
With an amazing song from LiSA to end the film, it is a masterclass in both action scenes and drama. The tension is palpable, you fear for the safety of the characters, and you can't help but be emotionally wrecked by the events of this movie.
