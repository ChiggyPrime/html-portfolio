<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am your relatively average dude who enjoys gaming and movies.</p>

<p>I spent about a decade living and working in China, and have been able to develop my language skills while there.
  I can speak relatively fluent Cantonese, and I would consider myself to be at an intermediate level for Mandarin.</p>

<p>Due to the situation with the pandemic, I had to return home to my native country of Canada, and I am now seeking a change in careers, perhaps into web development.</p>
